# Group-Project-Snake
Creating an instance of the well-known Snake game, implementing OOP principles.

Description:
The game has two levels of difficulty(worm, python). The snake aims to eat as many fruits as possible to gain points and avoid obstacles. Obstacles are the mushrooms. In the first mode of the game (worm), if a mushroom is eaten, the snake gets shorter. Additionally, in the second mode of the game (python), the snake will also lose one of its three lives: when reaching 0 lives, it is game over. If the snake touches itself, it will die immediately. The player wins the game if the snake takes over the whole grid area. Use the W (Up), A (Left), S (Down), and D (Right) keys to play.

Issues:
When the SnakeUI file is executed it loses the focus. For proper usage of the game, one needs to click to any window and then go back to java frame.
